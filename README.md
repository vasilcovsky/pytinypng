 * Skip already optimized files.

## Installation
Get Python 2.7 at [http://www.python.org](http://www.python.org). If youâ€™re running Linux or Mac OS X, you probably
already have it installed.

If you are on Mac OS X or Linux, chances are that one of the following two commands will work for you:

```$ sudo easy_install pytinypng```

or even better:

```$ sudo pip install pytinypng```

and then obtain TinyPNG API key from
[Developer API page](https://api.tinypng.com/developers).

## Usage
Run in terminal:

```pytinypng <input-directory> <output-directory> --apikey <API_KEY>```

You can hide api key in:
  * environment variable *TINYPNG_APIKEY* or *TINYPNG_API_KEY*
  * or save it inside working directory under name *tinypng.key*
  * or keep in your home directory as *~/.tinypng.key*
